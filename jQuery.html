            <h3 id="head3_1">What is a Web Application?</h3>
            <p>A Web application (Web app) is an application program that is stored on a remote server and delivered over the Internet through a browser interface.
               <span>This is span 1.</span></p>
            <p>Within the mobile computing sector, Web apps are sometimes contrasted with native apps, which are applications that are developed specifically for a particular platform or device and installed on that device.
               <span>This is span 2.</span></p>
            <p>However, the two are not mutually exclusive because many applications contain elements of both native and Web apps.
               <span>This is span 3.</span></p>
            <p>Programs that combine the two approaches are sometimes referred to as hybrid applications.
               <span>This is span 4.</span></p>
            <p>Single-page applications are more application-like because they reject the more typical web paradigm of moving between distinct pages with different URLs.</p>

            <h3 id="head3_2">Web app framework?</h3>
            <p>A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs.
               <span>This is Span 5.</span></p>
            <p>Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.
               <span>This is span 6.</span></p>
            <p>For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management, and they often promote code reuse.
               <span>This is span 7.</span></p>
            <p>Frameworks typically set the control flow of a program and allow the user of the framework to "hook into" that flow by exposing various events.
               <span>This is span 8.</span></p>
            <p>This "inversion of control" design pattern is considered to be a defining principle of a framework, and benefits the code by enforcing a common flow for a team which everyone can customize in similar ways.</p>

            <h3 id="head3_3">Different Web app Frameworks</h3>
            <p>Django is a full-stack open-source framework powered by Python and supports Python version up to 3.4. Full-stack means it provides all stuff needed “out of the box”. 
               <span>This is span 9.</span></p>
            <p>One more famous and reliable open-source MVC framework, created with Ruby. Before starting with RoR it would be advisable to familiarise yourself with Ruby. RoR was created to make coding of web-based applications simpler and faster.
               <span>This is span 10.</span></p>
            <p>Express.js is an open-source framework for Node.js to build classical web applications with server side and API. Roughly speaking it’s a standard server framework for projects that use javascript on the backend.
               <span>This is span 11.</span></p>
            <p>Angular is a javascript open-source framework designed specially for single-page web apps and mobile application development, using MVC architectural pattern. It is not a full-stack, but just a frontend framework dealing basically with your webpages.
               <span>This is span 12.</span></p>
            <p>React is one of them, created and supported by Facebook. Although React is actually not a full-stack framework, it provides only View-level (templating language) and some callback functions to render HTML code, it’s a powerful frontend tool.</p>
